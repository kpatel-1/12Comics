# IT491 Capstone Project | *12Comics Learning Support Program - MINIGAME*
# Academic Skyline Heroes

#Primary Objectives
* Develop a 2D minigame through the use of the Unity engine that will help provide a means for students (K-5) to work harder in school. 
* Heroes are created by students through a 3rd party hero creator found on 12Comics.com and ported into the game. 
* The students heroes can get stronger via earning points for achieving betters grades in school.

# Database Usage
An SQL database, hosted on the NJIT servers for the purpose of this project, was used to store user accounts that would be used to login to the game.
The database was used to store the following: Username, Password, Hero name, Highscore, and Player Stats.
* User accounts are created via the website and skill points are distributed by a 3rd party.
* Player Stats would be adjustable via the in-game UI and the highscore would be updated whenever a new personal highscore was met.
